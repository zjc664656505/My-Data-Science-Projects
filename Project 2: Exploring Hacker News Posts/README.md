## Project 2: Exploring Hacker News Posts
In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News.

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

Description of the dataset columns:

id: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post
title: The title of the post
url: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL
num_points: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes
num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the post
author: The username of the person who submitted the post
created_at: The date and time at which the post was submitted
In this project, we are particularly interested in the posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN.

Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.
Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.
