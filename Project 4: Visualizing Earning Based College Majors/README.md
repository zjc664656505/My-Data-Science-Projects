# Project 4: Visualizing Earning Based College Majors

1. In this project, we'll explore how using the pandas plotting functionality along with the Jupyter notebook interface allows us to explore data quickly using visualizations.

2. We'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.

3. The detail of the data set columns:
    1. Rank - Rank by median earnings (the dataset is ordered by this column).
    2. Major_code - Major code.
    3. Major - Major description.
    4. Major_category - Category of major.
    5. Total - Total number of people with major.
    6. Sample_size - Sample size (unweighted) of full-time.
    7. Men - Male graduates.
    8. Women - Female graduates.
    9. ShareWomen - Women as share of total.
    10. Employed - Number employed.
    11. Median - Median salary of full-time, year-round workers.
    12. Low_wage_jobs - Number in low-wage service jobs.
    13. Full_time - Number employed 35 hours or more.
